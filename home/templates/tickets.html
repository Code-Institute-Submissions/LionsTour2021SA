        <p>In these extraordinary times we hope everyone in the Lions family is safe and well. </p>

We delayed the launch of our ticket-inclusive packages to Priority Access Pass holders until later in the summer after consultation and advice from SA Rugby and the Lions. We will of course notify you when we go on sale later this year.</p>
